# TODO Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the ongoing development of uniffi-dart. The project generates Dart language bindings directly from Rust using the UniFFI framework, leveraging Rust traits `DartCodeOracle`, `Renderer`, `CodeType`, and `Renderable` for type-safe cross-language code generation.

## âœ… Completed Features

- [x] **Core Architecture** - Complete trait-based rendering system
- [x] **Basic Types** - All primitive types, duration, complex types (structs, enums, objects)
- [x] **Function Generation** - Complete function calling and FFI infrastructure
- [x] **Memory Management** - RustBuffer and type converters
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing** - 30 fixtures with 8 currently working fixtures
- [x] **Modern CI/CD** - Reliable GitHub Actions with smart caching
- [x] **Build System** - Workspace-level dependency management

## ðŸ”„ Development Priorities

### Critical (Blocks Multiple Fixtures)
- [ ] **HashMap/Map Support** - Core collection type missing
- [ ] **Proc-Macro Support** - Modern UniFFI development patterns

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
- [ ] **Callbacks & Async** - Interface callbacks and async/await support
- [ ] **Collections** - Complete sequence/list implementations
- [ ] **Trait Interfaces** - Display trait and error object support

### Medium Priority (Developer Experience)
- [ ] **Dictionary Default Values** - Named parameters with defaults
- [ ] **Trait Methods** - Advanced trait functionality
- [ ] **Resource Management** - Proper disposal patterns

### Low Priority (Edge Cases)
- [ ] **BigInt Support** - Large integer boundary handling
- [ ] **External Types** - Cross-crate type support
- [ ] **CLI Tools** - Command-line binding generation

## ðŸ“ˆ Current Status

**Foundation:** âœ… Complete - Rock-solid architecture with comprehensive test coverage
**Tooling:** âœ… Complete - Modern CI/CD pipeline with fast feedback loops  
**Next Phase:** Implementing the 5 critical blocking features to unlock full UniFFI parity

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with HashMap/Map** - Immediately unlocks multiple fixtures
2. **Add Proc-Macro support** - Enables modern development patterns
3. **Complete remaining high-priority features** - Full core functionality
4. **Polish developer experience** - Named parameters, advanced traits
5. **Handle edge cases** - BigInt, external types, tooling

**Development Environment:** Ready for immediate productive work with 10-minute test cycles and reliable CI/CD.
